# üöÄ BoltInvoices ‚Äì Automating Invoicing in the Order-to-Cash Cycle

This project highlights how I used **process mining** (Celonis), **process mapping** (Lucidchart), and **RPA** (UiPath) to streamline and automate the invoicing step in the Order-to-Cash process for Bolt Socks.

> üìâ I discovered that invoice creation was often delayed by more than a day after delivery confirmation. By automating this step using UiPath, I eliminated the delay, saved manual effort, and improved the overall throughput performance of the process.

## üîç Problem Statement

- **Issue Identified:** Manual invoice creation often occurred >1 day after delivery confirmation.
- **Impact:** Delayed cash flow, lower throughput target achievement, and increased administrative burden.
- **Opportunity:** Automate invoice generation and dispatch once delivery confirmation is received.

## üî¨ Process Discovery with Celonis

Using **Celonis Business Miner**, I analyzed over 5,000 Order-to-Cash cases. Key findings:

- ‚è±Ô∏è **Median Throughput Time:** 23.6 days  
- üéØ **Target Throughput:** 23 days  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Target Hit Rate:** 49%  

> The delay between **"Confirmed Delivery"** and **"Invoice Created"** emerged as a key bottleneck.

## üó∫Ô∏è Mapping with Lucidchart

I used **Lucidchart** to map out the full Order-to-Cash process, identifying automation points and separating human vs. system activities.

## ü§ñ UiPath RPA Project: "BoltInvoices"

I built a UiPath bot to automatically generate and email invoices as soon as a delivery confirmation email is received in Outlook.

### üß† Bot Logic

1. Open `Orders.xlsx`
2. Connect to Outlook 365
3. Check for unread emails from `cody.baldwin@wisc.edu`
4. If a confirmation is found:
   - Fill the invoice template with:
     - Order info
     - Today‚Äôs date
     - Due date (+30 days)
     - Amount from order file
   - Save invoice as PDF (filename includes Order ID)
   - Email invoice PDF to customer
   - Move email to ‚ÄúRPA‚Äù folder and mark it as read
   - Log processed order using `Write Line`
